BUG LIST:
   - cannot select random response from list of possible responses
        - prints out all possible responses at once
        - (random_elem commented out bcs it throws errors for inputs with only one response)
   - response patterns only work for a single word in front of key word
        - probably an issue with match/2 or fill_var/4 (or how they interact with each other)
   - problems wiht when to use "i" vs "me" in responses
