% *******  pertaining bugs and where we are at in the google doc notes *******

% *NOTE* at this point in program, all portions of P2 Notes
      up to the "Applications of the Onlology" section have been completed

% *BUG LIST*
   * cannot select random response from list of possible responses
        * prints out all possible responses at once
        * (random_elem commented out bcs it throws errors for inputs with only one response)
   * response patterns only work for a single word in front of key word
        - probably an issue with match/2 or fill_var/4 (or how they interact with each other)
   * problems wiht when to use "i" vs "me" in responses
   * need to figure out how to use Grammar rules in ChatBot
